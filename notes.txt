Steps:

-script creates CF stack and waits for it to finish launching
-script grabs the following info from the stack and sticks it into the file "configuration.json" in the results bucket:
--ASG
--sns_topic (if customer provided an email address)
-script also adds the following that were provided by the customer:
--number_of_files
-script uploads the wiglaf lambda code to the results bucket
-script updates the CF stack to contain the wiglaf lambda, and waits for that to finish.
-script bundles up the user's script and data and pushes it to S3 at bucket/resources.tgz
--wiglaf script will detect this uploads and scale up the ASG
--Each host will push contents to the S3 bucket.
--Once the necessary number of files has been uploaded, wiglaf will write a results file to the bucket with presigned URLs for all the result files, email the user the results, and scale down the ASG.
